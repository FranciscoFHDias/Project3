## Overview







## Project Brief

### The following requirements were a must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.

### The following deliverables were required:

* A **working app** hosted on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories/wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Link to your **pitch deck/presentation** – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
